# PM-Speech-and-Trend-Analysis
Did Speech and trend analysis to derive the significance of economy, education, farmers, doctors and China in PM speech. I took the data from the official site of Narendra Modi in text format (https://www.narendramodi.in/category/text-speeches)
First, cleaned the data frame removing "," and "." then converting the whole text dataset into lower case and converted it into a list. Used for loop for searching the word.
The Speech txt data.zip file contains 70 speeches of PM from Feb'20-Sep'20.
